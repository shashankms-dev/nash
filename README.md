# nash
A simple, clean and fast shell for Unix-like operating systems, written in C.

The idea is to have a bash-like shell but with a much smaller codebase and free of the feature creep and bloat that bash has come to be known for.
I am not yet sure if I want to write this in C and may end up writing it in Rust instead.
