A simple and fast shell for Unix-like systems, written in C.

This is a fun project to try and implement a fully functional, working shell for Unix in less than ~1000 lines of code.
I am also planning to re-write the same project in Rust.

Please feel free to suggest feature changes or additions. I shall try to make changes as suggested.
