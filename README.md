# nash
A simple and fast shell for Unix-like systems, written in C.

Writing this shell just as a learning project and not intending to make a serious production-grade shell.
I am not yet sure if I want to write this in C and may end up writing it in Rust instead (i.e. if Rust offers some useful enough abstractions that I don't feel like re-writing).
